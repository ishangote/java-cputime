Compile the java coden:

	javac CPUtest.java

Generate the JNI headerfile:

	javah -jni CPUtest

Compiler the library (Have no idea how this should be done on non-unix
systems):

	cc -o libjnicputime.so -O -shared cputime.c 

Set the library search path to include where libjnicputime.so is located: 

	setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH .

Run the program:

	java CPUtest

Or simply run "make" to build, and "make test" to run the code.
